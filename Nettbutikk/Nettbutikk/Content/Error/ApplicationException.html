    <h1>Oh noes! Unexpected obstacle encountered</h1>
    <p>Sorry, I've walked into an unseen lamppost (or something; I didn't really get that good a look at it before it disappeared) and am now very dizzy. I'll just have a short sit down over there and have a little breather. Just for a second. You try to go back or somewhere else and maybe try again in a short while.</p>
    <p>Also, somewhere, on a small office, someone is taking notice of this, hopefully. It should really not happen.</p>
